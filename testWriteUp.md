# Testing

For this project we used JUnit 5.9.1.

## Card

As this card makes use of an elegant record class, the one test we did could be considered redundant as this is an inbuilt class, however this was both of our first time using a record class so we did one test.

## Deck

Deck has 5 tests in total with most relating to its single threaded performance.
